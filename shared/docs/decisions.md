# Note taking app/website
Our group decided to go with a note taking app/website, letting the user pick up a note from the stack and write on it.

The website won't save their notes without logging in.

When logged in, it should save their notes to their user accounts, with the note content (and possibly position, unless we go with a grid layout).

The user can choose between at least 4 piles of different colored note-piles, and the user can choose different fonts to use, along with possibly background color/texture.
